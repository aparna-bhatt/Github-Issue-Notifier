# Github-Issue-Notifier
I Made this project to learn more about github API's.

Also there is a feature on github which notifies you of new issues coming up in you forked repo but it
not only sends you notification of new issue but also of comments/commits on existing open-issues which from my view is very disturbing.

So to enhance this feature I used the github API's to find new issues
in the forked repo of the user and send him/her a notification in mail.

Feel free to register (some more changes to be made :))
